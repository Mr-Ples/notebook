#### Where I am, Where I'm coming from, Where I'm going

My [Twitter page](https://x.com/evalladen) is a type of journal that documents real time updating/building of my world model. It documents my ongoing trajectory from rigid militant no bullshit atheist rationalism (you know the type, I debated Christians for a year before this) to somewhere new. 

This new place seems to incorporate a lot of concepts from Theology and Mysticism, which is no surprise to me now since concepts from Theology and Mysticism is the subject matter of Ethics and Aesthetics. This connection between Theology/Mystecism and Aesthetics/Ethics is something I had to discover, since it is unknown to the militant rationalist (and to the world in general, at least explicitly, at least in the philosophy of Aesthetics and Ethics, at least as far as I know).

I am finding that I might not end up in the Christian or Mystic community, since for some reason my ethic is not compatible (at least as far as I can tell right now, and I don't really understand why yet), but I will still end up somewhere new.

And the tower I built along the way would constitute new knowledge of the landscape. And this new knowledge would likely be nothing more than a rationalist frame on Theological/Mystical concepts. But it has promise to be the logic of new theories in Aesthetics and Ethics, which are fields that are all but stale and dead (as far as I can see). And has promise for so much more (see [MFC model](motive_frame_content.md)).

#### Call to action

This journey is not just an intellectual one, updating my world model involves living in the world I am creating while I am creating it (instead of say, armchair philosophy), and in particular adopting a new ethic, which involves finding a new place within new communities, which involves discovering the incenstive structures that a rationalist needs to integrate into some place new.

Therefore it would be emensely helpful to have friends in Mystic and Religious places who are wiling to lend a hand in one way or another, be it by sharing their perspective, pitting their ethic against mine, or being a representative for their respective schools of thought.
