## Aesthetics

Aesthetics is the study of value representation.

**Commentary**: representation means relating to measurement or computation with the purpose of communicating or signalling value or relevance/salience

**Commentary**: this means "frameworks" or syntax fundamentally have an aesthetic component. Since a framework or framing or language or syntax is a set of design decisions of what concepts are to be made explicit and what concepts are to remain inexplicit, for the purpose of expressing a specific type of truth or problem or solution

**Alternative/Conflicting definitions**

Aesthetics is a form of implementation dependence [^1].

## Beauty

Beauty is a form of information with causal power that consists mostly of inexplicit content (within the field of value representation).

**Commentary**: Flowers are beautiful because they contain information that reliably causes transformations in the mind of an observer (i.e. that of demanding attention or causing attraction). This information is entirely inexplicit; it is captured entirely within how the flower presents itself to the observer.

Riding a bike is almost entirely inexplicit, but it does not classify as beautiful because the task being performed is that of locomotion not value representation.

**Alternative/Conflicting definitions**:

Beauty is an aesthetic that is characterized by soft, rounded, and often delicate appearance [^1].

**Commentary**: This means a piece of art can be e.g. Sublime without being beautiful. Since the sublime is characterized by being e.g. epic. This conflicts with the above definition because in the above conception the sublime is a type of beauty, whereas with this definition the sublime and beauty are both a type of aesthetic.
