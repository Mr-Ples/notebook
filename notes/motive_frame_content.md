### Outline

The relevance of what I am about to say will almost certainly not be clear, that is why there is a need to develop a framework. Also everything is subject to change since it's early days. For now I just call it the motive/frame/content model or MFC for short.

The main idea is simple: all beliefs or memes (the fundamental unit of knowledge or culture) are cognitive-affective, not just cognitive. There is an entire emotional machinery that is attached to all beliefs that receives almost no attention. That is all just saying that all beliefs consist of explicit content and implicit content.

The implicit content consists of two components: the motive and the frame.

Thats it.

I'll briefly explain the relevance: 

I have identified 2 catagories within which you can neatly group an enourmous amount of concepts that have all up to now only implicitly related to each other, namly Action Tendencies and Value Representations (see image for the concepts that fall in each group).

It turns out that Ethics is the study of Action Tendencies and Aesthetics is the study of Value Representation. This usage of the terms Ethics and Aesthetics are generalizations of how the concepts are normally used. (The generalization doesn't just fall out of the sky, postulating "value representation" as the general catagory that Aesthetics is responsible for links value and representation and Aesthetics, like an equation `A=VR`, similarly for Ethics and action, none of this is trivial)

I've found this classification to have unexpected consequences and isomorpisms (will be explicated, lightly documented on my twitter) that were not intentionally baked in, which hints at the (potential for the) existence of an actual theory that posits these relationships and categories that is waiting to be discovered (instead of an ad hoc classification system), which could be the basis for grounding Aesthetics and Ethics in the scientific world.

I have also found a remarkable resiliance when using this model to translate concepts from world views unfamiliar to me (such as Theology and Mysticism) into these terms without a loss in structure or contradiction (!!!)


### Motivations


This framework has already brought me immense value, some things it has done:
1) Provides a lens through which I can see culture and translate what Mystics and Christians are talking about, and answer esoteric philosophical questions and problems that even Rationalists have (which is something I have always wanted to do).
2) The classification put forward above and elaborated a bit in my Twitter has allowed me to explore so much ground in the landscape of Aesthetics and Ethics and place guide posts so that the terrain is tangible and has concrete directions of future exploration. This was impossible before, I simply did not see the relevance or value of the terrain, it was just an unknown.
3) Given me hope for unification between Rationalism and her enemies
4) Provided seeds for an Epistemology of Implicit knowledge that would be relevant if I decide to pursue AGI (or to just understand how the brain creates knowledge)
5) Affirmed the existence of egregors (which clearly exist by observation, you could literally point it out to people, but you can't do so without a framework, especially as a rationalist)
6) Provides entry points into fields of science/math such as Psychology, Neuroscience, Cognitive Science, Game Theory, AI (esp multi-agent learning algorithms)

### Future

I am still documenting my trajectory through the terrain, which involves investigating what is interesting to me at the level of resolution that is interesting to me. Which means there is not yet enough meat on the bone to convince others, but this has pulled me in further than any project before and I am optimistic that it will bear fruit.
